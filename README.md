# Starter Code for Problem Set 7

This project provides some guidance on problem set 7, starting with some work we will do together in class. **Start by forking this project so that you can push your code.**

* Download [Mr. Schroeder's data](https://piazza.com/class/jkjtds7xjxd3jy?cid=350) from Piazza.

* Move the file, using the terminal, to this project.

* Commit and push the file. Always good to have a permanent copy of something that might vanish.

* Create a process_data.R file in which we will save code that deals with all our data.

* Get Upshot Data

* Get rid of Senate/Governor races from Upshot.

* Keep only those polls from Wave 3.

* Create a new variable with the 4 possible characters which contain district info. (Hint, they are always at the same spots.)

* Create two new variables, state and district, which are similar to the ones on the JS data.

* Combine Upshot/Siena JS.

* Calculate some statistics of interest at the district level.

* Create some interesting graphics.

* Create a Shiny App.
